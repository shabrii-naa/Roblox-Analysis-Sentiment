This project analyzes sentiment from 9,996 Google Play reviews of Roblox using a lexicon-based approach. Sentiment labels (positive/negative/neutral) are generated by matching tokens against Indonesian positive and negative lexicons and aggregating their scores.
To evaluate how well the labels can be learned by a supervised model, I also trained an SVM classifier using TF-IDF and Bag of Words features. 

Method (Lexicon-Based Labeling)
1. Preprocessed text using cleaning, case folding, tokenization, stopword removal (Indonesian + English), and stemming (Sastrawi). 
2. Loaded positive and negative lexicons from a public GitHub dataset. 
3. Calculated sentiment score for each review by summing lexicon word scores:
   score > 0 → positive
   score < 0 → negative
   score = 0 → neutral
   
Results: 
Label distribution (lexicon-based):
Positive: 4,932
Negative: 4,404
Neutral: 660 

Supervised Baseline (SVM)
Using the lexicon-generated labels as training targets:
- TF-IDF + SVM achieved 0.876 train accuracy and 0.8375 test accuracy
- BoW + SVM achieved 0.996 train accuracy and 0.811 test accuracy (showed overfitting)
